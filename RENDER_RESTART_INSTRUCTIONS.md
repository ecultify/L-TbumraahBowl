# 🔄 How to Restart Failed Video Render

## ✅ Quick Fix Steps:

### **Step 1: Clear Failed Status**

Open browser console (F12) and run:
```javascript
sessionStorage.removeItem('videoRenderStatus');
sessionStorage.removeItem('videoRenderId');
console.log('✅ Cleared failed render status');
```

### **Step 2: Go Back to Analyze Page**
```
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/analyze
```

### **Step 3: Automatic Re-render**
The page will detect your score (90%) and automatically start a new render in the background!

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual Trigger

If auto-render doesn't start, click the **"View Video Report"** button manually. This will:
1. Check if render is needed
2. Start a new render
3. Show progress on download page

---

## 🐛 Why Did It Fail?

From your terminal logs, the error was:
```
Internal error: TypeError [ERR_INVALID_STATE]: 
Invalid state: ReadableStream is already closed
```

This is a **Next.js development server issue** (not Lambda). The render might have actually succeeded on AWS!

## ✅ Let's Verify the Render

Run this in browser console to check if the video actually exists:
```javascript
fetch('https://remotionlambda-apsouth1-fp5224pnxc.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/renders/zprenwuqh1/out.mp4', {method: 'HEAD'})
  .then(r => {
    if (r.ok) {
      console.log('✅ Video exists! Size:', r.headers.get('content-length'));
      const url = 'https://remotionlambda-apsouth1-fp5224pnxc.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/renders/zprenwuqh1/out.mp4';
      sessionStorage.setItem('generatedVideoUrl', url);
      sessionStorage.setItem('videoRenderStatus', 'completed');
      window.location.href = '/download-video';
    } else {
      console.log('❌ Video not found, need to re-render');
    }
  });
```

---

## 🎬 Fresh Start (Clean Slate)

```javascript
// Clear everything and restart
sessionStorage.clear();
window.location.href = '/analyze';
```

---

## 📝 Summary:

The render **started on Lambda** but the **local dev server crashed** before it could poll for completion.

**Two possibilities:**
1. ✅ Video rendered successfully on AWS (check with verification script above)
2. ❌ Need to start a new render (clear status and go to analyze page)

Try the verification script first - the video might already be ready! 🎉
