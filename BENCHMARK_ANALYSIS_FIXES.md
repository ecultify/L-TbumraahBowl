# Benchmark Analysis Fixes

## Problem Summary
The TensorFlow bowling action analysis was not properly comparing uploaded videos against the benchmark pattern, producing inconsistent or incorrect similarity scores.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Inconsistent Normalization Scale**
- **Issue**: The velocity calculations were using only the current frame's body scale for normalization, which could fluctuate frame-to-frame.
- **Fix**: Now averages the normalization scale between consecutive frames for stability.
- **Code Changes**:
  - `calculateArmSwingVelocity()`: Now uses `(prevScale + currentScale) / 2`
  - `calculateBodyMovementVelocity()`: Now uses `(prevScale + currentScale) / 2`

### 2. **Incorrect Movement Thresholds**
- **Issue**: Fixed absolute thresholds (0.1, 0.2, 0.5) didn't account for the actual benchmark pattern scale.
- **Benchmark Pattern Stats**:
  - Average arm swing velocity: **10.680**
  - Max arm swing velocity: **40.948**
  - Average overall intensity: **13.155**
  - Max overall intensity: **45.699**
- **Fix**: Implemented **relative thresholds** based on benchmark pattern values:
  - Minimum avg arm swing: 10% of benchmark avg (~1.07)
  - Minimum max arm swing: 10% of benchmark max (~4.10)
  - Minimum avg intensity: 8% of benchmark avg (~1.05)
  - Minimum max intensity: 8% of benchmark max (~3.66)

### 3. **Improved Logging**
- Added velocity ratio logging (input/benchmark) to help debug normalization issues
- Enhanced threshold checking to show percentages relative to benchmark
- Better visibility into why videos pass or fail movement detection

## How It Works Now

### 1. **Velocity Calculation**
```
For each frame:
1. Extract pose keypoints using TensorFlow MoveNet
2. Calculate body scale from both current and previous frame
3. Average the scales for stability
4. Calculate distance moved for each keypoint
5. Normalize by averaged body scale: velocity = distance / (timeDelta * scale)
6. Weight keypoints by importance (wrists > elbows > shoulders)
7. Weight by confidence scores
```

### 2. **Movement Validation**
```
For uploaded video:
1. Check if BOTH upper body AND lower body keypoints detected (full body required)
2. Calculate avg and max velocities for:
   - Arm swing (most important for bowling)
   - Overall intensity (body + arms)
3. Compare against relative thresholds (% of benchmark)
4. If below thresholds â†’ Return 0 (triggers "No Bowling Action" modal)
5. If above thresholds â†’ Proceed with detailed similarity analysis
```

### 3. **Similarity Calculation**
```
For valid bowling action:
1. Resample both input and benchmark velocities to same length
2. Smooth arrays to reduce noise
3. Calculate Pearson correlation (shape similarity)
4. Calculate DTW similarity (timing-robust comparison)
5. Blend: 60% DTW + 40% correlation
6. Apply weighted components:
   - Arm swing: 40%
   - Release point: 25%
   - Rhythm: 15%
   - Follow-through: 15%
   - Run-up: 10%
   - Delivery: 5%
7. Return overall similarity (0-1) â†’ Convert to percentage (0-100)
```

## Expected Behavior

### Valid Bowling Video
- **Keypoints**: Both upper and lower body detected in >50% of frames
- **Movement**: Arm swing velocity reaches at least 10% of benchmark pattern
- **Result**: Similarity score between 0-100% based on how close to Bumrah's technique

### Invalid Video (No Bowling Action)
- **Triggers**:
  - Missing lower body keypoints (legs not visible)
  - Missing upper body keypoints (arms/shoulders not visible)
  - Insufficient arm swing movement (< 10% of benchmark)
  - Overall movement too low (< 8% of benchmark)
- **Result**: Returns 0, triggers "No Bowling Action Detected" modal

### Static/Minimal Movement Video
- **Triggers**:
  - Peak arm swing < 4.1 (10% of benchmark max ~40.95)
  - Average movement < 1.07 (10% of benchmark avg ~10.68)
- **Result**: Returns 0, triggers "No Bowling Action Detected" modal

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test with benchmark video itself**: Should get ~95-100% similarity
2. **Test with similar bowling action**: Should get 60-90% similarity
3. **Test with different bowling style**: Should get 30-60% similarity
4. **Test with non-bowling video**: Should return 0 (no bowling action)
5. **Test with upper-body only**: Should return 0 (full body required)

## Debug Console Output

When analyzing a video, look for these key console messages:

```
âœ… Loaded single benchmark pattern from /benchmarkPattern.json
ðŸ“Š Input armSwingVelocity - avg: X.XXX max: XX.XXX
ðŸ“Š Benchmark armSwingVelocity - avg: 10.680 max: 40.948
ðŸ“Š Velocity ratio (input/benchmark) - avg: 0.XXX max: 0.XXX
âœ… Full body keypoints check passed
âœ… Movement thresholds passed - sufficient bowling motion detected
ðŸ“Š OVERALL SIMILARITY: 0.XXX (XX.X%)
```

## Files Modified

- `lib/analyzers/benchmarkComparison.ts`:
  - `calculateArmSwingVelocity()` - Improved normalization
  - `calculateBodyMovementVelocity()` - Improved normalization
  - `getFinalIntensity()` - Relative thresholds + enhanced logging
  - `checkRequiredFullBodyKeypoints()` - Validates full body visibility
