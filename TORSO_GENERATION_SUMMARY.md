# ✅ Background Face Detection & Torso Generation - Implementation Summary

## What You Asked For

1. ✅ Face detection runs in background after video upload
2. ✅ Detected face sent to Gemini AI to generate torso image
3. ✅ **Modified prompt** to generate image only till chest (no hands/arms)
4. ✅ Output image positioned on composite card at **140px from top, 15px from right**

---

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Gemini Prompt Updated** (`lib/utils/geminiService.ts`)

**Before:**
- Generated torso with "arms folded across chest"
- Hands and arms were visible

**After:**
- ✅ Generates **chest-level portrait only**
- ✅ **NO HANDS, NO ARMS, NO SHOULDERS** visible
- ✅ Shows only head/neck down to mid-chest
- ✅ Enhanced negative prompt to explicitly exclude: `hands_visible, arms_visible, shoulders_visible, folded_arms, crossed_arms, hands_in_frame, elbows_visible, forearms_visible, wrists_visible, fingers_visible`

### 2. **Composite Card Position Updated** (`components/CompositeCard.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
top: `${102 * scale}px`,
right: `${10 * scale}px`,
```

**After:**
```typescript
top: `${140 * scale}px`,   // ← Updated to 140px
right: `${15 * scale}px`,  // ← Updated to 15px
```

## ✅ Already Implemented (No Changes Needed!)

The background face detection functionality is **already fully implemented** in the application! 

### How It Works:

**File:** `app/video-preview/page.tsx`

1. **Auto-starts** when video loads (lines 295-315)
2. **Background process:**
   - Detects faces using TensorFlow/MediaPipe
   - Crops the detected face
   - Stores cropped head in sessionStorage
   - Sends to Gemini AI
   - Gets generated torso image
   - Stores torso in sessionStorage

3. **User never waits** - they can immediately click "Continue" to details page
4. **Silent operation** - runs in background without blocking UI

---

## 🔄 Complete User Flow

```
1. User uploads video → /video-preview
2. [BACKGROUND] Face detection starts automatically
3. User reviews video, clicks "Continue" → /details
4. [BACKGROUND] Torso generation completes
5. User enters name/phone, clicks "Analyze Video"
6. Analysis runs → /analyze
7. CompositeCard shows torso image at (140px top, 15px right)
```

---

## 📦 Data Storage

**Session Storage Keys:**
- `croppedHeadImage` - Cropped face from video
- `generatedTorsoImage` - AI-generated torso (used in CompositeCard)

---

## 🎨 New Prompt Example

When Gemini receives the cropped face, it gets this prompt:

```
GENERATE AN IMAGE: Create a professional chest-level portrait 
photograph of an Indian cricket player using the EXACT face 
from the provided image.

CRITICAL: The image should show ONLY from the head/neck down 
to mid-chest. NO HANDS, NO ARMS, NO SHOULDERS visible - only 
the upper chest area with blue Indian cricket jersey.
```

## 🧪 How to Test

1. **Start dev server:** `npm run dev`
2. **Navigate to:** http://localhost:3000
3. **Upload a video** with a person's face clearly visible
4. **Click Continue** to video preview
5. **Open browser console** - watch for logs:
   ```
   🎯 Video loaded, auto-starting face detection...
   ✅ Face detection successful
   ✅ Head cropped successfully
   🎨 Starting Gemini 2.0 Flash Preview Image Generation...
   ✅ Torso generated successfully
   ```
6. **Continue to details**, fill info, analyze
7. **On analyze page**, scroll to CompositeCard
8. **Verify:**
   - Torso image appears at correct position (140px top, 15px right)
   - Image shows only chest (no hands/arms)
   - Image is between upperpart.png and bottompart.png

## 📊 Files Modified

| File | Status | Changes |
|------|--------|---------|
| `lib/utils/geminiService.ts` | ✅ **Modified** | Updated prompt to exclude hands/arms |
| `components/CompositeCard.tsx` | ✅ **Modified** | Changed position to 140px/15px |
| `app/video-preview/page.tsx` | ✅ **Already Done** | Background detection already working |

---

## 🎯 Key Points

1. ✅ **Background process** - Face detection runs automatically without user interaction
2. ✅ **Non-blocking** - User can navigate immediately while detection runs
3. ✅ **Chest-level only** - No hands or arms in generated image
4. ✅ **Correct positioning** - 140px from top, 15px from right
5. ✅ **Already integrated** - Uses test-faceswap logic, already in production flow
6. ✅ **Fallback ready** - If Gemini fails, uses canvas composite approach

## 📝 Reference Files

- **Main flow documentation:** `BACKGROUND_FACE_DETECTION_FLOW.md`
- **Test implementation:** `app/test-faceswap/page.tsx`
- **Face detection service:** `lib/utils/faceDetection.ts`
- **Gemini service:** `lib/utils/geminiService.ts`
- **Composite card:** `components/CompositeCard.tsx`

## 🚀 Ready to Test!

Everything is set up and ready. The functionality you described from `test-faceswap` is already integrated into the main application flow. I've just updated:
- ✅ The Gemini prompt to exclude hands/arms
- ✅ The composite card position to your specifications

**No further code changes needed!** Just test the flow and verify the torso appears correctly on the composite card. 🎉
