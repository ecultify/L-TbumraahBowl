# Full Body Keypoint Requirements

## Overview
This feature ensures that BOTH upper body AND lower body keypoints are consistently detected before allowing bowling analysis to proceed. Videos without complete body visibility will trigger the "No Bowling Action Detected" modal.

## Implementation Details

### Required Keypoint Categories

#### **Upper Body Requirements** (ALL must be satisfied)
- **Shoulders**: At least one shoulder (left_shoulder OR right_shoulder)
- **Arms**: At least one elbow AND one wrist detected
  - Elbows: (left_elbow OR right_elbow)  
  - Wrists: (left_wrist OR right_wrist)

#### **Lower Body Requirements** (ALL must be satisfied)  
- **Hips**: At least one hip (left_hip OR right_hip)
- **Legs**: At least one knee AND one ankle detected
  - Knees: (left_knee OR right_knee)
  - Ankles: (left_ankle OR right_ankle)

### Detection Parameters

```typescript
const FULL_BODY_THRESHOLD = 0.6; // 60% of frames must have complete body
const MIN_CONFIDENCE = 0.4; // Minimum keypoint confidence score
```

### Analysis Logic

```typescript
// Per frame validation
const hasUpperBody = hasShoulders && hasArms;
const hasLowerBody = hasHips && hasLegs;
const isCompleteBody = hasUpperBody && hasLowerBody;

// Overall video validation  
const fullBodyRatio = framesWithFullBody / validFrameCount;
const passesRequirement = fullBodyRatio >= 0.6; // 60% threshold
```

## What Gets Rejected

### **Upper Body Missing Scenarios**
- ❌ **Cropped shoulders**: Head-only videos
- ❌ **Missing arms**: Videos showing only torso
- ❌ **Occluded arms**: Arms behind back or out of frame

### **Lower Body Missing Scenarios**  
- ❌ **Sitting videos**: No legs/feet visible
- ❌ **Cropped at waist**: Upper body only videos
- ❌ **Desk/table blocking**: Lower body obscured

### **Combination Issues**
- ❌ **Partial visibility**: Either upper OR lower body missing
- ❌ **Poor detection**: Low confidence keypoints
- ❌ **Temporary occlusion**: Brief but significant keypoint loss

## What Gets Analyzed

### **Valid Full Body Videos**
- ✅ **Standing bowling**: Complete body visible throughout action
- ✅ **Full frame bowling**: Head to feet captured
- ✅ **Good lighting**: Clear keypoint detection
- ✅ **Stable camera**: Consistent body tracking

## User Experience

### **When Requirements Not Met**
1. Analysis immediately returns 0
2. Console logs detailed keypoint analysis:
   ```
   Full body keypoint analysis: 25/60 frames have complete body (41.7%), threshold: 60.0%
   Required full body keypoints not detected - bowling analysis requires complete body visibility
   ```
3. "No Bowling Action Detected" modal appears
4. Same user guidance as other rejected videos

### **Clear User Expectations**
The modal's existing requirements list remains relevant:
- ✅ "Clear view of the bowler in action" (now enforced)
- ✅ "Visible arm movements and body motion" (now enforced)  
- ✅ "Complete bowling motion (run-up to follow-through)" (now enforced)

## Technical Benefits

### **Ensures Analysis Quality**
- **Complete Data**: Analysis uses full body biomechanics
- **Consistent Comparisons**: All analyzed videos have same data completeness
- **Reliable Metrics**: Body movement calculations have complete input data

### **Prevents Edge Cases**
- **No Sitting Analysis**: Automatically filtered out
- **No Partial Body**: Eliminates incomplete data scenarios  
- **No False Positives**: Robust keypoint requirements prevent invalid analysis

### **Maintains User Standards**
- **Professional Requirements**: Encourages proper video recording
- **Clear Feedback**: Users understand why their video was rejected
- **Consistent Experience**: Same standards applied to all users

## Configuration Options

### **Adjustable Thresholds**
- `FULL_BODY_THRESHOLD`: Percentage of frames requiring full body (default: 60%)
- `MIN_CONFIDENCE`: Minimum keypoint confidence score (default: 0.4)

### **Keypoint Requirements**  
Can be adjusted based on testing:
- More strict: Require both shoulders AND both arms
- More lenient: Allow lower confidence scores
- Sport-specific: Adjust for bowling-specific keypoints

## Implementation Impact

### **Before This Feature**
- Videos with partial body visibility could be analyzed
- Sitting videos with upper body movement got similarity scores
- Inconsistent data quality across analyses

### **After This Feature**  
- Only complete body videos proceed to analysis
- Consistent data quality for all analyzed videos
- Clear user guidance for proper video recording
- Natural filtering of inappropriate videos (sitting, cropped, etc.)

This feature ensures that your bowling analysis maintains the highest standards by requiring complete body visibility, leading to more accurate and meaningful analysis results.
