# Face Swap Process - FINAL CLARIFICATION ✅

## Exactly What Happens

### Input Images:
1. **📹 Video Frame**: Contains Face A (person from uploaded video)
2. **🖼️ Base.png**: Contains Face B (existing person in base image)

### Face Swap Process:
- **Source**: Video Frame (Face A) 
- **Target**: Base.png (Face B gets replaced)
- **Result**: Base.png image structure but with Face A replacing Face B

### Visual Representation:
```
BEFORE SWAP:
📹 Video Frame    🖼️ Base Image
   [Face A]          [Face B]
      ↓                ↓
   Person 1         Person 2

AFTER SWAP:
🖼️ Final Result
[Face A in Base Image Structure]
         ↓
Person 1's face in Person 2's image
```

## Technical Implementation

The API call configuration is correct:
```typescript
{
  source_image: base64Data,        // Video frame (Face A)
  target_image: baseImageBase64,   // Base.png (Face B to be replaced)
  // Result: Base image with Face A replacing Face B
}
```

## What the User Sees

1. **Upload**: Video containing a person (Face A)
2. **Detect**: System finds Face A in video frame
3. **Swap**: Face A replaces Face B in base.png
4. **Result**: Base image layout/background/body with Face A instead of Face B
5. **Download**: Modified base.png with the video person's face

## Key Points

- ✅ **Base.png already contains a face** (Face B)
- ✅ **Video contains another face** (Face A)  
- ✅ **Face A replaces Face B** in the base image
- ✅ **Base image structure remains** (background, body, etc.)
- ✅ **Only the face changes** from Face B to Face A

The face swap correctly takes the face from your video and replaces the existing face in base.png! 🎯
