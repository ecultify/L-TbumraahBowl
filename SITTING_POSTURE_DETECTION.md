# Sitting Posture Detection Feature

## Overview
This feature prevents videos of people in sitting postures from being analyzed for bowling action, ensuring that only standing bowling motions are processed by the system.

## Implementation

### Core Detection Algorithm
The system analyzes pose keypoints across multiple frames to determine if a person is consistently in a sitting position.

### Key Detection Methods

#### 1. Hip-to-Knee Angle Analysis
- **Sitting**: Hip-to-knee angle > 45° (more horizontal)
- **Standing**: Hip-to-knee angle < 45° (more vertical)

#### 2. Knee-to-Ankle Relationship
- **Sitting**: Knees typically at or above ankle level
- **Standing**: Ankles typically below knee level

#### 3. Body Compactness Analysis
- **Sitting**: More compressed vertical body spread
- **Standing**: Extended vertical body spread

### Detection Parameters

```typescript
const SITTING_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.6; // 60% of frames must indicate sitting
const KEYPOINT_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.4; // Minimum confidence for keypoint detection
const SITTING_ANGLE_THRESHOLD = 45; // Degrees from vertical
const COMPACTNESS_THRESHOLD = 1.2; // Vertical spread to body width ratio
```

### Multi-Frame Analysis
The system analyzes multiple video frames to ensure consistent posture detection:
- Processes all available frames with pose data
- Requires 60% of frames to indicate sitting posture
- Handles partial keypoint visibility gracefully

## User Experience

### When Sitting is Detected
1. Analysis immediately returns 0 (no bowling action)
2. "No Bowling Action Detected" modal appears
3. User is guided to record/upload a standing bowling video

### Console Logging
Detailed logging provides insight into detection process:
```
Posture analysis: 45/60 frames indicate sitting (75.0%), threshold: 60.0%
Sitting posture detected - bowling analysis not applicable
```

## Integration Points

### BenchmarkComparisonAnalyzer
- `detectSittingPosture()`: Main detection method
- `analyzeSittingInFrame()`: Per-frame analysis
- `calculateAngleFromVertical()`: Angle calculation utility

### Analysis Pipeline
Sitting detection occurs before movement threshold checks:
1. **Posture Check**: Detect sitting posture
2. **Movement Check**: Analyze movement thresholds (if standing)
3. **Similarity Analysis**: Compare to benchmark (if valid bowling action)

## Robustness Features

### Handles Edge Cases
- **Partial Visibility**: Works with incomplete keypoint data
- **Low Confidence**: Filters out unreliable keypoint detections
- **Camera Angles**: Adapts to different recording perspectives
- **Temporary Occlusions**: Uses majority voting across frames

### Graceful Degradation
- Returns `null` for indeterminate frames
- Requires minimum number of valid analyses
- Falls back to movement-only detection if posture is unclear

## Testing Scenarios

### Should Detect Sitting
- ✅ Person sitting on chair/bench doing bowling motions
- ✅ Seated position with visible legs
- ✅ Wheelchair users performing bowling actions

### Should Allow Standing
- ✅ Normal standing bowling delivery
- ✅ Crouched bowling position (delivery stride)
- ✅ Kneeling follow-through positions

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ Partial leg visibility
- ✅ Dynamic sitting-to-standing transitions
- ✅ Low-quality video with poor keypoint detection

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Clear Guidance**: Users understand why their video wasn't analyzed
- **Consistent Standards**: Ensures fair comparison across all users
- **Professional Feedback**: Maintains app credibility

### Analysis Quality
- **Improved Accuracy**: Only analyzes appropriate bowling stances
- **Reduced False Positives**: Eliminates inappropriate similarity scores
- **Better Benchmarking**: Ensures like-for-like comparisons

### System Reliability
- **Robust Detection**: Multi-metric approach reduces false negatives
- **Adaptive Algorithm**: Handles various video qualities and angles
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Enables debugging and optimization

## Configuration

### Adjustable Thresholds
All detection thresholds can be fine-tuned based on real-world testing:
- Sitting confidence percentage
- Keypoint confidence requirements
- Angle thresholds for posture classification
- Body compactness ratios

This feature ensures that your bowling analysis system maintains high standards for meaningful motion analysis while providing clear, helpful feedback to users.
