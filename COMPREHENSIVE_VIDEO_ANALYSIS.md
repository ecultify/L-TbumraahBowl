# Comprehensive Video Analysis Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the head swap test page to analyze the entire video and automatically select the frame with the most visible and clear head, replacing the previous simple 2-3 second frame capture logic. The system now detects entire heads (including hair, forehead, face, chin, and neck) rather than just faces, and performs complete head swapping.

## Key Features Added

### 1. **Full Video Analysis**
- **Smart Sampling**: Analyzes frames at optimal intervals (every 0.5s or 60 samples max)
- **Time Window**: Skips first/last 10% of video to avoid intro/outro issues
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress bar showing analysis completion

### 2. **Multi-Metric Quality Assessment**
Each frame is scored on 5 key criteria:

#### **Brightness Analysis (25% weight)**
- Optimal range: 80-200 with preference for ~140
- Avoids too dark or overexposed frames

#### **Contrast Analysis (20% weight)**
- Edge detection to measure feature clarity
- Higher contrast = clearer facial features

#### **Sharpness Analysis (20% weight)**
- Sobel edge detection algorithm
- Identifies crisp, well-focused frames

#### **Skin Tone Detection (20% weight)**
- Multiple skin tone range detection
- Enhanced algorithms for different ethnicities
- Prioritizes frames with higher skin pixel ratio

#### **Head Region Analysis (20% weight)**
- Focuses on expanded upper-center area (15-85% width, 5-65% height)
- Includes hair detection (dark areas get 1.5x weight)
- Weighted scoring for likely head locations including hair, face, and neck
- Combines brightness, contrast, skin tone, and hair detection

### 3. **Advanced Scoring Algorithm**
```typescript
// Optimized for head detection (includes hair and full head region)
overallScore = (
  brightnessScore * 0.25 +
  contrastScore * 0.20 +
  sharpnessScore * 0.20 +
  skinScore * 0.15 +      // Slightly reduced since hair doesn't have skin tone
  headScore * 0.20        // Increased weight for expanded head region analysis
)
```

### 4. **Enhanced User Interface**

#### **Progress Visualization**
- Real-time progress bar during analysis
- Frame count and percentage display
- Time position tracking

#### **Comprehensive Debug Panel**
- Overall quality score with gradient bar
- Individual metric breakdowns
- Detailed analysis results
- Visual quality indicators

#### **Status Updates**
- "Analyzing entire video to find the clearest head..."
- Frame-by-frame progress: "Analyzing frame 15/60 (25%) at 7.5s..."
- Final result: "âœ“ Best frame selected at 12.5s (Score: 0.847, Brightness: 142, Contrast: 18.3, Sharpness: 22.1)"

## Technical Implementation

### **Core Functions**
1. `findOptimalFrame()` - Main analysis orchestrator
2. `analyzeFrameQuality()` - Frame scoring engine
3. Progress tracking and UI updates

### **Analysis Pipeline**
1. **Video Scanning**: Sample frames across entire video duration
2. **Quality Assessment**: Multi-metric analysis per frame
3. **Ranking**: Sort frames by overall quality score
4. **Selection**: Choose highest-scoring frame
5. **Final Capture**: Seek to best position and capture high-quality version

### **Performance Optimizations**
- Efficient sampling intervals based on video length
- Pixel-level analysis with optimized loops
- Raw frame capture for better analysis accuracy
- Final enhanced capture for face swap API

## Benefits

### **Improved Head Swap Quality**
- Automatically finds frames with clearest heads (including hair, face, neck)
- Better lighting and contrast for API processing
- Higher success rates for head detection algorithms
- Complete head swapping instead of face-only swapping

### **User Experience**
- No manual frame selection needed
- Visual feedback during analysis
- Detailed quality metrics for transparency
- Progress indication for longer videos

### **Reliability**
- Works with various video types and qualities
- Handles different lighting conditions
- Robust scoring system with multiple fallbacks
- Comprehensive error handling

## Usage Example

```
1. User uploads a 30-second bowling video
2. System analyzes 60 frames (every 0.5s from 3s to 27s)
3. Progress bar shows: "Analyzing frame 35/60 (58%) at 17.5s..."
4. Best head frame selected at 12.5s with score 0.847
5. Debug panel shows: Brightness: 142/255, Contrast: 18.3, Sharpness: 22.1, Head Region: 85%
6. Head detection proceeds with optimal frame
7. Complete head swap includes hair, face, and neck region
```
